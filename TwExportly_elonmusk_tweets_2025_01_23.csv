'1882136853480079830',"RT @PirateWires: NEW PIECE from Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar on Pirate Wires: Trump will get America out of “manager mode” 

• While SpaceX put more than 300 rockets into orbit for less than $10 billion, California has built 1,600 feet of elevated rail for $11 billion, and now projects its high speed rail project will cost a total of $128 billion. 

• Congress earmarked $7.5 billion in 2021 for a half-million electric-vehicle charging stations. By May 2024, only eight had been built. Not 8,000. Not 800. Eight.

• The federal government allocated $42.5 billion on rural broadband and has connected zero homes after three years.

• Unimaginably large parts of Los Angeles were just destroyed by a devastating fire while its fire hydrants didn’t work, and while fire department leadership seemed more focused on DEI than saving lives. 

Something has to change. Our politicians can no longer remain fixated on steady, predictable preservation of the status quo. Instead, we need a leader who will fight for the country, is willing to risk change, and who realizes America’s exceptional potential. 

Link is threaded to @ssankar's full piece on why Trump will pivot the country back to founder mode — and usher in a golden age for America and its people.👇",en,Retweet,1187,9146,1964,526,2160618,2025-01-22 13:42:48,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,photo,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gh6ur9ta8AA7qoW.jpg

'1882136803467231257',"RT @realchrisrufo: They're going to try to memory-hole this, but we can't forget that the Left put America through a reign of terror after 2020. This is some of what they did to me and my family, in an attempt to shut me up:

When I was in Seattle, they put up posters around my neighborhood with insane lies about me and my home address, instructing activists to show up at my door. Later, they sent letters to a few hundred of my neighbors, claiming I was a Nazi white supremacist. Death threats, references to my family, the whole deal. A few times, we had to take the kids and leave town.

One of these activists found one of my children at the park with the babysitter and yelled at him until he started crying. My son came home terrified, so I figured out who this person was—a software developer in the neighborhood—got his number, called him, delivered some ""persuasive"" words, and forced him to apologize to my son over the phone. I made sure he was much more frightened than my son.

The same group organized employees within Microsoft to bomb my wife's boss with emails claiming she was a white supremacist. Thankfully, he thought it was strange for her to be an Asian white supremacist and knew it was all a fabrication. I tracked down the ringleader and, ""coincidentally,"" he was fired a few months later. He overestimated his position and underestimated mine.  

Then there were the calls and texts to our private numbers. Threats to rape my wife and murder my children. At one point, I was working with the FBI about it, but the perpetrators had used number-cloaking apps and there was nothing law enforcement could do. I thought we had a lead in St. Louis and hired a private investigator to look into it, but the trail went cold. We fortified our home and studied the law. I was prepared to kill anyone who crossed the threshold.

The institutions got in on it, too. Organized campaigns to ruin my reputation, manipulate my Wikipedia page, cancel my speaking engagements, and list me on the websites of the SPLC and ADL, in an attempt to get me banned from social media. The censorship apparatus put a target on my back and the federal government egged them on. Fortunately, they all failed.

For years, I refused to publicly acknowledge much of what happened to my family—I didn't want to give my enemies the satisfaction—but now is the time to get it out and address it. My experience is hardly unique; many other conservatives have faced similar circumstances. It's about CRT, DEI, and all of the other intellectual issues, but even more, it's about having a society free of threats, violence, intimidation, and madness.",en,Retweet,4783,44182,9258,1889,3669371,2025-01-22 13:42:37,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

SoftBank has $38b in cash, $142b in debt and generates $3ish billion in FCF per BBG.  They own $143b in ARM and $18b in BABA.  If they start selling ARM, their stake will be worth much less very quickly.

Oracle has $11b in cash, $88b in debt and generates $10b in FCF.

OpenAI is burning cash.

MGX did not commit to a number and is a $100b fund.  Maybe 10% of the fund goes into this best case.

Nvidia will limit how much they invest in any one model company (they don’t need a monopsony). Maybe $5b.

Barring the aforementioned SoftBank ARM sale, might be able to put together $50b in equity funding over several years.  Can obviously finance the GPUs and put debt on the JV.

Nowhere close to $500b.  Everyone should just start issuing press releases for $1 trillion AI projects.

BTW love it that the ticker MGX which is a biotech company is up 33% on this.

“This is what victory feels like! 

And this was no ordinary victory. This was a fork in the road of human civilization. 

You know, there are elections that come and go. Some elections are important, some are not. But this one really mattered. 

And I just want to say thank you for making it happen. My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured. 

Thanks to you, we're going to have safe cities, finally, secure borders, sensible spending. Basic stuff. 

And we're going to take Doge to Mars! I mean, can you imagine how awesome it will be to have American astronauts plant the flag on another planet for the first time? How inspiring would that be? 

You know, there's always problems in life. Solve that problem, solve that problem. But, you know, there need to be things that inspire you. There needs to be things that make you glad to wake up in the morning and say, I'm looking forward to the future. 

I love you guys. And let me tell you, I'm gonna work my ass off. I really will. I really will. I'm super fired up for the future. It's going to be very exciting. 

As the president said, we're going to have a Golden Age. It's going to be fantastic. 

One of the fundamental things, one of the most American values that I love is optimism. This feeling like we're going to, make the future good. We're going to make it. 

So, man, I can't wait. This is going to be fantastic. Thank you again. I'm just so excited about the future. Thank you, guys.

And I think it was only a matter of time before they suspended my account. For sure, given the stuff I've said lately, they would have suspended me six ways to Sunday.

Pretty much all the social media companies and Google and everyone are controlled by far-left activists. That's the truth of it. How do you know what's real when it's all filtered through a far-left, San Francisco, Berkeley lens?

They just manipulate the truth constantly. You can't even find the truth if you google it, because Google has put it on page six.

At least there's one place where you can find out what's actually going on and what's real, and that's the 𝕏 platform.”

'1881457403297730573',"RT @JTLonsdale: I’ve been looking forward to this week. I invested time, money, and reputation convincing powerful friends of the dangers and corruption of the American left and the damage being done to our citizens, culture, and institutions. I encouraged them to speak up and call for reform. …

We are about to witness a patriotic fireworks show of action unlike anything we have seen in D.C.; for many conservatives, this is the most exciting policy week of our lives. …

To some, this day of triumph might seem the wrong time to sound a note of caution. But history reminds us that the seeds of self-destruction can be sown at the moment of our greatest victories. …

Courage is a strength of the new administration. For many of my friends, it took courage to speak out against problems in society and in favor of Trump. If we speak with the same principles and courage we brought to the 2024 campaign, I’m confident the checks on the presidency will remain resilient, so that all our children and grandchildren inherit a nation of laws, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.",en,Retweet,382,10723,1435,601,4420521,2025-01-20 16:42:55,"<a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter Web App</a>",,,,

'1881037038759072081',"RT @jgebbia: I have a confession to make:

I did a bad thing.

Something the younger me

Would hate myself for doing.

Something that only a few people (and maybe Bytedance) know:

I voted Republican last November.

I know, I know

I can hear the crush of disappointed voices: Say it ain’t so, Joe.

And yes, I can hear other voices cheering in the background, welcome to the club.

*

So I would like to take a few moments to explain this choice to my younger self who cast his first ballot for Al Gore in 2000.

Young Joe, first of all, stop frosting the tips of your hair, it’s not cool.

Secondly, those Democrats you’ve voted for your whole life aren’t the same party they used to be.

Like your fashion sense, they’ve lost their way.

Hopefully they’ll make an effort to win people like me back.

*

Yes, I know I’m late to the party on this, and there’s already a thick gold chain in the punch bowl.

(I hope he drops the Facebook Files in there next.)

But today we stop hiding the truth from our close Never Trumper friends: That we support a party that isn’t going to run this country into the ground.

A country that people from all over the world dream about living in.

I love our nation, our people, and even our standard measurement system.

We were told by the media that loving this country meant hating Trump, and for many years I believed that.

Until I committed the second greatest sin that I’d like to confess today:

I did my own research.

And I found something that shocked me.

He is not a fascist determined to destroy democracy.

He deeply cares about our nation. (I also happen to deeply care about our nation.)

He deeply cares about safe cities. (I also like my car still being where I parked it in the morning.)

He deeply cares about government efficiency and spending. (I also care about the next generation, and love the whole DOGE initiative.)

He cares about bringing common sense back to our country. (So do I.)

He cares about making our borders secure. (I actually don’t like going through the customs process myself, but I do respect the fact these safeguards exist.)

*

I did, however, find a problem, something that stopped me in my tracks, besides dropping a meme coin on the eve of the inauguration:

One of his cabinet picks, RFK, is saying some pretty out-there things.

I think the establishment may even be more afraid of him than Trump.

For starters, this crazy guy wants to make our tap water safer to drink.

This guy wants us to stop over-medicating.

This guy wants to make our grocery store aisles less poisonous.

This guy is clearly a threat to our way of life. Doesn’t he know how much money these companies make slowly killing us?

So I did that bad thing again and looked into these ideas with an open mind.

Lo and behold, I found out that they were exactly what our country needed. Desperately.

Make America Healthy Again.
Make America Great Again.
Make America America Again.
Say it with me, MAAA.

*

I’m guessing even young Joe wouldn’t have liked living in the eggshell ages of these last few years.

A time of silence, shaming, and fear, where calling a duck a duck meant you hated ducks.

It was kind of like the dark ages, complete with its own plague, but with more modern forms of torture, like having to watch CNN for news.

So, if like me and many others, you also had a woke-up call, it’s time to talk about it. Better late than never.

It’ll unburden you, and you’ll no longer have to live a lie, pretending like the other party had a good plan in place.

'1878532847105118400',"RT @Scobleizer: I did 35 videos at CES. 

The most mind blowing was #9 and the most important for the future is #29. 

But this is just a very small portion of what is at CES. The award winners are at https://t.co/GVGzBgX85o and those 500 products are the best of the best. Much easier to look through all of them than walking the huge halls. 

One thing I wish I had spent more time in is the medical device hall. I just didn't have time, unfortunately, but the devices there, like new rings and watches that can sense the human body will bring a new kind of health care to humans.

'1880413292251984065',"RT @TheFP: EXCLUSIVE: @SpeakerJohnson tells @BariWeiss that President Biden hasn’t been in charge for a while.

In January 2024, when Johnson and Biden were alone in the Oval Office, the president couldn’t recall an important executive order he had signed just three weeks earlier.

Johnson recalled telling Biden: “Sir, why did you pause LNG exports to Europe? Liquefied natural gas is in great demand by our allies. Why would you do that?”

Biden, according to Johnson, was stunned. “I didn’t do that.”

“He genuinely didn’t know what he had signed,” Johnson said. “And I walked out of that meeting with fear and loathing because I thought, ‘We are in serious trouble—who is running the country?’ Like, I don’t know who put the paper in front of him, but he didn’t know.”

“The booster flight was a success, the ship flight was 1/4 successful, hence cup being ~5/8 full.

New ship forward flaps, higher thrust engines and tile adherence on ascent were tested.

Improved heat shield performance was the only major thing that wasn’t tested, along with the “Pez” payload dispenser.

Probably solved in next month’s launch.

The 9 meter diameter version of Starship will probably fly ~10,000 times, so this is barely a bump in the road.

Doesn’t change the likely date at which Mars becomes self-sufficient.”

“It's wild that this giant 250-ton object went to space, came back, and was caught by giant Mechazilla arms.

It's super cool!

That's the kind of thing that is inspiring and exciting.

There's a lot of potential.

I think we can actually build a permanently occupied science base on the moon.

We can build a city on Mars.

We can be a multi-planet species.

And be out there among the stars. It's very exciting!”

“I'm a huge fan of Elon Musk.I think he's got the most incredibly forward-thinking ideas about where we can go technologically.

What he's done, nobody else has ever done. He's landed a rocket ship, so it's reusable. You know what a feat that is?

Now, we're taking off, we're going to Mars, delivering stuff to people who are going to be settling there just like they settled the old West. And bringing those ships back and landing them and reloading them.”

'1880002729516626281',"RT @MarioNawfal: 🚨SPACEX STARSHIP FLIGHT 7 LAUNCHES TODAY!

SpaceX is set to launch its 400-foot-tall Starship rocket today in about 1.5 hours from Starbase, Texas. 

Live coverage begins 35 minutes before liftoff.

Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, is made up of two reusable parts:

the Super Heavy booster, which provides the raw power to leave Earth, and the Starship spacecraft, designed to carry humans and cargo to orbit, the moon, and Mars.

SpaceX says 2025 will be a “transformational” year for the rocket as it works toward making the entire system reusable. 

The ultimate goal? 

Regular, ambitious missions that could one day make SpaceX the FedEx of the cosmos.

'1879922664329875966',"RT @MarioNawfal: 🚨🇺🇸 GEORGIA FINES TWO DEM AFFILIATED GROUPS FOR $300K FOR ELECTION VIOLATIONS

The New Georgia Project and its Action Fund, founded by Stacey Abrams and once led by Senator Raphael Warnock, were fined a record $300,000 for failing to disclose $4.2M in donations and $3.2M in spending during the 2018 election to boost Abrams’ campaign.

Abrams, the two-time Democratic gubernatorial candidate, stepped away from the group in 2017 and denies involvement. 

Warnock, the preacher-turned-Senator listed as CEO from 2017-2019, says compliance wasn’t his job. 

How convenient.

The groups also hid $646K in donations and $174K in spending during a failed 2019 transit referendum. 

Ethics officials called it a “shameful” effort to hide election spending, with one even suggesting the violations should carry criminal penalties.

We've got, obviously, a permanently-occupied base in Antarctica.

And you can do, I think, a lot more research if you have the scientists actually there.

As wildfires destroy homes and lives, criminals are swooping in to loot what little remains. 

DA’s Nathan Hochman and Todd Spitzer are demanding Gov. Newsom make looting during emergencies a felony punishable by prison time and strikes under California’s Three Strikes Law.

Spitzer:

“We must demand accountability, and we must demand punishment, for those who are seizing the opportunity to plunder what little remains.”

The proposal would force looters to face judges, ban diversion programs, and add years to sentences for crimes during emergencies.

'1879786175738601931',"[continued] 
The depth of Musk's brand erosion among ordinary Britons was driven home to me during a recent conversation with our falconer (who, despite his modest profession, holds two advanced degrees in medieval history). He compared Musk to a ""bloody tosser,"" which I'm told is quite strong language among the working classes. Our head gardener, who maintains our authentic 12th-century herb garden (though we've added kale), nodded in sage agreement while trimming our heritage rose bushes with Japanese scissors blessed by a Zen master.

I find myself uniquely positioned to understand this divide, straddling as I do the worlds of tech wealth and authentic British cultural heritage. True, I may have purchased this castle with the proceeds from my early PayPal investment, but I've made a point of really immersing myself in the local community. Why, just last month I allowed the village primary school to view our battlements from a respectful distance during their history lesson. The gratitude in their little faces was quite moving, though the teachers really should work on their curtseying.

The tragedy is that Musk seems genuinely unaware of how he's perceived by the salt-of-the-earth types who form the backbone of this great nation. During my weekly meditation sessions in the restored medieval dovecote (now a wellness space for our domestic staff), I often reflect on how disconnected he's become from the reality of ordinary British life. Unlike myself, who makes a point of regularly interacting with our household staff, groundskeepers, stablehands, and the various artisans we keep on retainer.

Our castle's ancient stones have witnessed centuries of social change, as our architectural historian (a lovely woman who used to be something in banking before finding her true calling) often reminds me. From these battlements, one can literally see the divide between Musk's Twitter bubble and the real Britain – though admittedly, one has to look past our organic vineyard and the solar-panel-equipped guest lodgings (former servant quarters, now a retreat space for burned-out tech executives).

Just this morning, while discussing the matter with our butler (who, despite his role, holds strong views on cryptocurrency), I was struck by how much Musk could learn from my own approach to wealth and privilege. True, we may have our own private wind turbine and a moat stocked with heritage trout, but we make a point of sharing our good fortune – why, we've even opened the castle grounds to the public one day each leap year, though naturally we had to hire additional security to manage the crowds.

The local pub (which we recently purchased to prevent it from becoming a Tesco) is particularly illustrative. The regulars there – whom I've had extensively surveyed by our community relations team – express a deep skepticism about Musk's various pronouncements. Of course, I don't visit personally (one must maintain certain standards), but our head of household affairs provides regular reports on the sentiment among the common folk.

Perhaps most telling was the reaction during our recent ""Digital Feudalism and the Future of Work"" symposium, held in our converted great hall (now a LEED-certified conference space). Several of our domestic staff – invited to observe from the minstrels' gallery, naturally – expressed what I'm told were quite strong opinions about Musk's management style, though they were thoughtful enough to do so in whispers.

I worry that Musk has created a perception of himself as some sort of modern-day robber baron, completely out of touch with the common man. How different from my own approach of maintaining authentic connections with ordinary British life, even if primarily through our carefully curated staff of artisanal craftspeople and reformed investment bankers turned organic farmers.",en,Reply,68,1221,77,75,65812,2025-01-16 02:02:03,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

As the sun sets behind our restored crenellations (the restoration supervised by three different historical preservation consultants), I can't help but feel that Musk could learn much from my own example of modest, understated wealth. Now, if you'll excuse me, our chef has prepared a tasting menu themed around ""The Digital Proletariat,"" and I believe the peasant bread course (made with heritage wheat grown in our medieval-authentic fields) is about to be served.

Namaste, of course. Though these days, one must be so careful about cultural appropriation, as our diversity consultant (Harvard, naturally) regularly reminds our household staff during their mandatory sensitivity training sessions.",en,Reply,77,1276,85,223,61922,2025-01-16 02:03:09,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

Brand Erosion at Dawn: Observing Musk's UK Reputational Collapse from My Norman Keep

As I gaze across the morning mist settling over our estate's organic sheep meadow (sustainably grazed, naturally, with each lamb hand-named by our shepherd, a former Goldman Sachs VP who found his true calling), I find myself pondering the tragic disconnect between Elon Musk and the honest working people of Britain. Just yesterday, while discussing the matter with Jameson, our groundskeeper (Cambridge, classics, '82), I was struck by how profoundly out of touch the man has become with the ordinary British citizen.

One sees it most clearly during my weekly visits to the village, where I make a point of personally collecting our artisanal sourdough from Mohammed (brilliant fellow, Oxford PPE) at the local bakery. The common folk – and I mean this with the deepest respect, having spent countless hours observing them from our castle's restored medieval watchtower – they simply don't relate to Musk's particular brand of technological solutionism anymore. Why, just last week, Lady Luna's personal yoga instructor (a lovely woman from Manchester, though she's since reformed) mentioned that her brother, who I believe does something in trade, finds Musk's tweets increasingly problematic.

The disconnect becomes particularly apparent during our monthly ""Conversations with Commoners"" dinner series, where we invite selected villagers (properly vetted by our social inclusion committee, of course) to dine with us in the great hall. Last month's theme was ""Digital Oligarchy and the Crisis of Late Capitalism,"" and our chef prepared a seven-course meditation on wealth inequality, featuring locally-foraged mushrooms arranged to spell out ""eat the rich"" in a delightfully ironic commentary.",en,Reply,249,2109,147,210,306720,2025-01-16 02:00:16,"<a href=""http://twitter.com/download/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter for iPhone</a>",,,,

'1879392517684420643',"RT @MarioNawfal: 🚨🇺🇸 ELON'S FEDERAL WORKFORCE STRATEGY BACKED BY REMOTE WORK DATA

Trump advisers Elon and Vivek's plan to end federal work-from-home could trigger massive voluntary exits - exactly what they want. 

New Pew data shows 46% of remote workers would quit if forced back to office, rising to 61% for full-time remote staff.

Their Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) strategy targets 1.1 million federal employees currently eligible for remote work. 

With younger workers (50%) and women (49%) most likely to quit over office returns, the policy could naturally reduce federal headcount while keeping veteran employees who prefer in-person work.

'1879371462739739075',"RT @KanekoaTheGreat: NEW: Marc Andreessen breaks down Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)

Regulation Overhaul:
“There’s a recent Supreme Court ruling on executive authority and Chevron Deference.”
This opens a powerful window for the executive branch to cut unnecessary regulations and scale back bloated agencies.

Bureaucratic Bloat:
“There’s a rumor that nobody knows the exact number of federal agencies. Estimates range from 450 to 500.”
“We now have ‘independent agencies.’ I’ve read the Constitution—there’s no provision for independent agencies.”

Ghost Town Offices:
“Federal buildings in D.C. have an average occupancy rate of 25%—lower than San Francisco.”
“There are agencies where employees come in just one day a month… and even that’s combined into two days every two months.”

Spending Reform:
“There’s a law from 1974 that prevents the President from spending less than Congress appropriates. If you read the Constitution, it doesn’t say that.”
“It’s worth revisiting impoundment—should the President have the power to save taxpayer money by not spending everything Congress allocates?”

Direct Public Engagement:
“Ross Perot had flip charts, Proxmire had the Golden Fleece Award—but they only got a few minutes of airtime once a year. What does Elon have?
The ability to ventilate information directly to the public.”
“This isn’t PR anymore—it’s direct interaction with the people.”

Presidential Power:
“If the people are on board with the President, he has tremendous power to push Congress to act.”
“All great presidents knew this—Reagan knew it, FDR knew it, and Trump knows it.”

July 4, 2026: DOGE sunsets, but its impact could be long-lasting.

'1879113769818657104',"RT @EvaVlaar: 🇳🇱 A group of underaged asylum seekers brutally gang raped a 33 y/o Dutch homeless woman last year and were just sentenced to a mere 4 to 15 months in a “youth detention facility”.

Fives boys, ages 15 to 18, found the woman sleeping on a bench in a park. They dragged her to a quiet spot, repeatedly gang raped her anally and vaginally, punched her in the face and stole her phone. Later that night police officers found the woman basically left for dead, bleeding, with her pants still down.

The court pointed out that because the perpetrators are foreign unaccompanied minors in the Netherlands, “they still need a lot of help and guidance in functioning in Dutch society” and proceeded to sentence them under juvenile law for sentences between 4 and 15 months. 

So there you go: No deportation, nothing. Just 15 months of playing board games, receiving an education and staying at a detention center for about a year and then they’ll be back on track to receive their Dutch citizenship as if nothing ever happened. All paid for by Dutch taxpayers, of course. 

As I point out all the time: our judicial system is deeply corrupt and rotten.
