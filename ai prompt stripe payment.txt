App maker, app maker, make me an app!

I want to build a React application called "Wickedly Viral" with the following features:

1. Core functionality:
   - home page user can login with username and password and login button, or click create account button.
   -if login, just take them to the main app page Tweet Analysis (no database yet, so dont need to check any passowrd)
   - if create account, users create an account with first name, last name, username, password (no dbs setup yet, so for now just save this somewhere locally like login_info.csv with cols username, password) and click "create account"
   -next page is membership type page.  users choose monthly subscription for $20/month or one month membership for $25.
   - next page is payment page. Here they enter credit card info and click pay.  Stripe will handle paymet. Each of these options has a sepearte stripe price id. All the relevent API keys are in my 2 .env files, one for the front end and one for the backend server that handles the stripe payment.  Just tell me what to call the varibles in these 2 .env files.
   - next if payment is successful, it goes to the page Tweet Analysis. 
   - On Tweet Analysis page, which is styled like the movie Wicked with green and pink colors, they can drag in a csv of tweets with columns text and favorite_count.  When they drag it it in, a table appears below wth text and favorite_count, ranked by favorite_count in descending order.  Add some floating bats in the background.
   -Add a logout button to Tweet Analyis that takes me back to the homepage

2. Visual design:
   - Use green/pink color scheme that fits the Wicked theme
   - Name the app a clever Wicked + social media themed name,
   - Floating bats in hte background of Tweet Analysis

3. Technical requirements:
   - Built with React (create-react-app)
   - Use Stripe for handling payment on a seperate backend java server
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Make it responsive for different screen sizes
   - Add error handling for non-csv files

Please generate ALL the necessary files for this application:
1a. A complete package.json with all required dependencies for front end
1b. A complete package.json with all required dependencies for backe end
2. App.js with the full React component
3. tailwind.config.js for the Tailwind setup
4. postcss.config.js for PostCSS configuration
5. index.css with all required styles including Tailwind directives
6. server.js file with backend server code
7. A components folder with all the component files.  Put all compents in here, so App.js can import them.  This makes the app more modular and eaiser to edit.

I will create an app in VS code, and then add in or edit the app files.  Please provide a full file directory and insttructions on what to created or edit, and how to run the app.  Assume I begin with VS code and have already installed nodjs.
